# Online Retail Data Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a data analysis project on online retail data. The project aims to analyze customer transactions and identify patterns in product purchasing behavior using association rules.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from an online retail store. It contains information about customer transactions, including order details, product information, and quantities purchased.

- **File**: `Online Retail Data.csv`
- **Columns**:
  - `order_id`: Unique identifier for each transaction
  - `order_date`: Date of the transaction
  - `customer_id`: Unique identifier for each customer
  - `product_code`: Code identifying the product
  - `product_name`: Name of the product
  - `quantity`: Quantity of the product purchased
  - `price`: Price of the product
  - `amount`: Total amount for each transaction (quantity * price)

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Convert date columns to datetime format.
   - Remove rows with missing customer IDs or product names.
   - Standardize product names to lowercase.
   - Remove rows with test product codes or names.
   - Remove cancelled orders.
   - Adjust negative quantity values to positive.
   - Remove rows with negative prices.
   - Calculate the total amount for each transaction.
   - Replace product names with the most frequently occurring name for each product code.
   - Remove outliers.

2. **Prepare Basket Data**:
   - Create a basket DataFrame with order IDs as rows and product names as columns.
   - Encode the DataFrame with True for products purchased and False for products not purchased.
   - Filter transactions with more than one unique product.

3. **Apply Apriori Algorithm**:
   - Generate frequent itemsets (sets of frequently purchased products) using the Apriori algorithm.
   - Calculate support for each itemset.
   - Compute association rules with metrics such as confidence.
